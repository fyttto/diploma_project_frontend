## Description

electronic-seal Mine safety management platform, dual-end integration project

## introduction

Install "electronic seals" in coal mines and non-coal underground mines that have been shut down for a long time, stop construction, and are currently shutting down. By installing cameras, image analysis terminals, electronic locks and other equipment, remote monitoring of key locations and key equipment can be realized. Develop a nationwide intelligent monitoring software platform, network with mine-end "electronic seal" equipment, and use informatization, intelligence, and video recognition technology to remotely monitor the personnel entering and exiting the mine, the number of changes in the number of people, and the start and stop status of related equipment. Analyze abnormal conditions and realize automatic alarm and information push, so that the supervision and supervision departments at all levels can timely find and grasp the illegal activities of coal mines and non-coal underground mines that have been shut down for a long time, construction and are being shut down. Use the analysis results to conduct targeted inspections on enterprises, and strictly prevent long-term closure of coal mines and non-coal underground mines to illegally organize production activities.
